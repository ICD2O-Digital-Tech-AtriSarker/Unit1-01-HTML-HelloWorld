  <h3>My favorite passtime: Gaming</h3>
  <p>Gaming is my favorite passtime because it is very fun and enjoyable to do.</p>

  <h3>My Least Favorite Subject: Literature</h3>
  <p>Even though I like reading and English classes as a whole, I don't like the literature unit/subject at schools because I find the compulsory novel studys and analysis topics very boring and uninteresting. </p>
